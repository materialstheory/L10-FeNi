# FCC-Supercell-Generator
Generates a NxNxN FCC supercell and assigns random first nearest neighbor couplings. Three files are written 
namely, momfile, posfile, and jfile which can be used as an input for Uppsala Spin Dynamics Code.

fcc_v2.ipynb --> efficient implementation of assigning couplings to reverse pairs (almost two times faster than fcc.ipynb)

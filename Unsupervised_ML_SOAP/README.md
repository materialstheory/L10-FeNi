### Aim of this project is to obtain further insights into the correlation between the local atomic environment of an Fe atom and its Orbital Moment Anisotropy (OMA) in L10 FeNi using Unsupervised machine learning methods (dimensionality reduction algorithms)  

### Note: This notebook is part of the research article "Effect of chemical disorder on the magnetic anisotropy in L10 FeNi from first principles calculations". For further explanation of the plots below, please refer to the original article.
